This project is a real-time face recognition system that captures video input, identifies known users, and logs their information to Firebase. It integrates face recognition using OpenCV and the face_recognition library, fetching known users' images and names from Firebase Storage and Realtime Database. When a match is found, the system uploads a photo and timestamp to Firebase as a history log. It also supports multithreading to ensure efficient video processing and data uploading. The solution can be used for automated security or attendance systems, providing seamless user identification and logging.
